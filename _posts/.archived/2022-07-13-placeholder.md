As you can see, this is a placeholder for until I finish writing the chapter.

I *probably* won't be using much of the markdown formatting, since the edits to the css I made messed them up and I can't be bothered to fix it **right** now. One of the main problems is ***bolded italics*** so I'll leave this as a note to myself to fix it. Okay, somehow I did fix that. Few minor other things to fix up, then. Also the caching is pretty wonky.
