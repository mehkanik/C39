Lorem ipsum or some shit. Chrome is borked when it comes to cacheing so I've been hard refreshing and yet it keeps reverting to some cached version I shouldn't have since I cleared my cache completely.

So I guess, somehow, github's cdn is serving me the wrong page that I updated, until I hard refresh which makes it go "okay real version", then it goes back to being stale if I do a regular refresh. How the hell does that make sense?
